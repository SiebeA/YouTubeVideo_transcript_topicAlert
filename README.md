# YouTubeVideo_transcript_topicAlert

Application goal:
    I follow Scott adams on Youtube. Scott covers a wide range of topics, some which I want to evade, some which I do not want to miss. I want to match the exact videos in which He talks about this or that, or X times about this or that. 
    Even deeper: 2 words close together appearance in a video; i.e. whenever "Naval" & "bitcoin" occur in between 100 characters, I get a list of episodes in which that condition is satisfied
    feature: for every new video in which condition (x1,x2,xN) is satisfied, get a notification.
